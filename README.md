> <a name="initial-setup-note"></a>Important: If you already have the collection into your Postman application, you should first remove it before import.
> If not, the latest collection (copy) you import will change all collection reference UUID's, making the future commit/merge unreadable.

#### Collection data

Choose the one that best fits the testing situation you need:

- Main GitHub repository | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/detailnet/lw-inside-postman/master/collections/default.json
- Own GitHub fork | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{own-git-user}/lw-inside-postman/master/collections/default.json
- Local checkout trough protobox | http://lw-inside-postman.collections.web01.detailnet.me/default.json

> You can also access different branches on GitHub (replace `master` with the branch name)

#### Import environments

- Go to the environments manager window
  - Move the mouse pointer over the eye dropdown menu (top bar)
  - Click on "Manage environments"
- Click on "Import" button, choose all files in the project environments directory (all at once)

> There is no direct possibility to import from an url, but you can use your OS as wrapper. 
> To do so enter an url instead of a file in the file selection window (e.g.: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/detailnet/lw-inside-postman/master/environments/development.json).

#### Setup global variables

We use global variables to store data that is your own, and must not be shared with others.

Currently we support following global variables:

 - `credential_application_id`: API application ID _(used for production environments)_
 - `credential_application_key`: API application Key _(used for production environments)_

Set up global variables:

- Go to the environments manager window
  - Move the mouse pointer over the eye dropdown menu (top bar)
  - Click on "Manage environments"
- Click on "Globals" button
- Add the variables

> API credentials for Louis Widmer Inside are stored at [3scale](https://detailnet-admin.3scale.net)
